                  ISO 18013 is an international standard that defines the specifications for driving license cards, particularly focusing on their physical and digital formats. It ensures interoperability and security, making it easier for licenses to be recognized across borders. It covers aspects like the layout, data encoding, and features necessary for both physical cards and mobile driving licenses (mDLs), ensuring global consistency in the way driving credentials are handled.
